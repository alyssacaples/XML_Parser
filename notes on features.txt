
For instance, the dark grey is the background (feature 1). This is also called the silicon substrate.

The lighter grey structures are called the doped regions (feature 2). You can see an example of them in the 5kv folder.

The bright white structures are called metal traces (feature 3). You can see an example of them in the 5kv folder for via plus poly.

There are dimmer white circles too (feature 4). They are the last features.

Feature 3 and 4 are on different layers. Feature 3 is closer to the top/imaging plane (hence the brightness). The dimmer circles are on the layer below. Its a 3D structure.  You have to annotate each feature with a different label.
